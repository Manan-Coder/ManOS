# ManOS

This is a web based operating system(obviously not),this is it's first version and I will add further updates in it time to time.I aim to make it as similar as possible to an actual os.
It is has different features like camera,voice recorder,browser and a notepad, calendar,calculator,todo and a terminal with working commands.
