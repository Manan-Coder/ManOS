# ManOS

This is a web based operating system(obviously not),this is it's first version and I will add further updates in it time to time.I aim to make it as similar as possible to an actual os.
It is has different features like camera,voice recorder,browser and a notepad rn.I am willing to update features in it time to time and the taskbar below is non-fuctional rn.Will make it functional and search,downloads option.Oooof,I have a lot work to do.
